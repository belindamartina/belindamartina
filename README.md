### 💡 Why Work With Me?
Most developers build; most writers explain. **I do both.** My unique background allows me to:
* Document code by reading the source directly.
* Build applications that are localization-ready (i18n) from Day 1.
* Create user guides that reduce support tickets by anticipating user frustration.
